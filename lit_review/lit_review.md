## A First Look at Online Reputation on Airbnb, Where Every Stay is Above Average
### Georgios Zervas, Davide Proserpio, John Byers -- Boston University
[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2554500]
* Based on our analysis of ratings we collected for over 600;000 properties listed on Airbnb worldwide, we find that nearly 95% of Airbnb properties boast an average user-generated rating of either 4.5 or 5 stars (the maximum); virtually none have less than a 3. 5 star rating. We contrast this with the ratings of approximately half a million hotels worldwide that we collected on TripAdvisor, where there is a much lower average rating of 3.8 stars, and more variance across reviews
* Ratings and reviews are central to platform : build trust, facilitate trade, determine how listings are ranked
* Trust can be challenging to build in marketplaces that are loosely regulated (like that in the sharing economy)
* Cross listed properties on TripAdvisor and Airbnb: 14% have 4.5 stars on Airbnb than on TripAdvisor
* Based on searches, Airbnb customers tend to be more price sensitive
* Reviews are critical to the individual success of the seller and Airbnb as a whole
* hosts take great lengths to avoiding negative reviews (like rejecting guests that are “unsuitable” or listing the location a second time on a new page)


## The Rise of the Sharing Economy: Estimating the Impact of Airbnb on the Hotel Industry
### Georgios Zervas, Davide Properpio, and John Byers -- Boston University
[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2366898]
* Studies the effect of Airbnb’s entry into short-term accommodation market in Texas its impact on the incumbent hotel industry
* According to Airbnb, in many cities, over 70% of their properties are outside the main hotel districts (meant to complement the current hotel industry not compete)
* Airbnb impacts the hotel industry during periods of peak demand : significant seasonal variation in supply and is correlated with periods of peak demand
* As hotels and Airbnb get closer in proximity, there is a magnified negative impact from Airbnb on hotels
* Incentives for consumers to list their homes on Airbnb: paying their mortgage, unemployment (helps drive Airbnb adoption and cause the demand for hotel rooms to soften)
* In the short-run: Airbnb can affect price and occupancy in the short run
* In the long-run: impact on hotels' entry, exit, and investment decisions
* Business travelers and vacationers who frequent high-end hotels are two consumers less likely to substitute a hotel stay with an Airbnb stay. Business travels are less price sensitive because reimbursed for their costs and need facilities  that are provided by hotels
* Viable but imperfect alternative for certain traditional types of overnight accommodation

#Murray Cox's take on the July Airbnb report:
http://insideairbnb.com/nyc-the-war-against-commercial-listings-continues/
* Still an issue - 6,000 entire homes are being rented for more than half the year --> no longer available on the rental or owner occupied housing markets
* Only talk about the median occupancy rate because skewed to the left
* Only being particular with the law in cities where they are under scrutiny
* 9% of multiple entire home listings as a percentage of entire homes in NYC (lowest, highest is San Diego)

#Short Changing New York City :The impact of Airbnb on New York City’s housing market

* Vocab:
1. Entire Apartment/Home : unique units that allow rental of entire homes/apts
2. Regular short term: booked for rental periods < 30 days, are booked for more than one reservation in a month, have at least one non-booked day/month
3. Commercial: unique listings that either:
..* are listed for at least 3 months/year by "multilisters"
..* or are listed for at least 6 months per year by "single listers"
4. Five macro-neighborhoods
.. 1. East Village / Lower East Side
.. 2. Chelsea / Hell's Kitchen
.. 3. West Village / Greenwich Village / SoHo
.. 4. Williamsburg / Greenpoint / Bushwick
.. 5. Bedford Stuyvesant / Crown Heights

* Over 90 percent of the 51,397 Airbnb listings are concentrated in these twoboroughs, whereas less than 60 percent of the total housing supply in New York Cityis located in these boroughs. 
* More than 55% of Airbnb listings allow the booking of an Entire Apartment/Home
..* These entire apt/home listings are more prevalent in Manhattan macro-neighborhoods compared to Brooklyn macro-neighborhoods (In violation of the Multiple Dwelling Law if they have more than three units in the residential building)
* 30% listings are classified as commercial because they have more than one reservation/month (and based on number of units controlled by the host and length of time available on Airbnb)
..* Impact listings if they regularly participate in commercial activity --> more than half of these hosts have multiple listings --> generate $27.6 million in avg monthly revenue
* Currently: rental vacancy between 3.4 - 3.6%
..* Housing emergency because this rate is <5%
* If the "impact listings" were made available on the rental market --> vacancy rate would rise to 4% --> the impact would be stronger in each neighborhood
..* In West Village, Greenwich Village, and Soho current rate: 2.9% --> rise to 5%
..* In Chelsea/Hell's Kitchen current rate: 4.2% --> rise to 5.7%
* Average Airbnb monthly revenue is greater than median monthly asking price in five macro-neighborhoods
..* West Village/Grenwich/Soho average monthly revenue per Airbnb listing is $822 greater than median asking price

#The Sharing Economy And The Remaking Of Loyalty
##by Dan Ruch
https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/17/the-sharing-economy-and-the-remaking-of-loyalty/

* The sharing economy is "disrupting the concept of loyalty"
..* No incentive to be loyal to a hotel group if Airbnb can offer you a cheaper room in a better location w/ better amenities

#Where does loyalty lie in the collaborative economy?
http://rachelbotsman.com/work/where-does-loyalty-in-lie-in-the-collaborative-economy/

* In the 20th century: "institutional trust" - company created a product or a service and controlled the way it was distributed
..* brands had immense power over consumers to tell them wom and what to trust
* Today: erosion in confidence in established hierarchies --> decentralized platforms and marketplaces built on peer trust
..* Technologies are making it easier
* We are currently in a trust dance between people increasingly trusting direct connections with other people but falling back on the role of the established institution when peer trust fails
* As collaborative marketplaces grow, companies are forced to focus on their own loyalty solutions ot attract, grow and retain relationships
* Measure of trust =  reputation
..* reputational capital: sum of what a community thinks of you
..* kind of elite status : social standing is transparent to others and increasingly valuable
..* Airbnb celebrates the value of superhosts, form local groups that learn from each other, mega events where hosts swapped stories/secrets
