Notes from today's brainstorming meeting, in no particular order.

## Potential research questions
  * What does Airbnb market in NYC look like?
  * Impact of proximity of (hotels, subways, attractions) on listing price
  * How does Airbnb impact normal residential rent prices?
  * What happened after Airbnb purged ~1,000 listings from NYC?
  * Are the "bad actors" good hosts?
  * Can we easily find people who are gaming the system (e.g., multiple fake accounts likely by same person)?
  * Are there any signs of the positive effects (e.g., boost to local businesses) that Airbnb claims?
  * How do people get guests?
  * How do words/terms in reviews affect price?
  * Where do the renters come from?
  * Where are people booking?
  * How long do they stay?
  * Value of subletting vs. posting on Airbnb
  * How do people advertise their places?
    * What words are effective for ratings, boosting price
	* Geographically discriminating words (words conditional on location)
    * Where are the safe locations?
  * Company policy changes (e.g., near Redmond, Seattle, etc.)
  * Impact of the photo quality on listing price

## Data questions
  * How can we use average value rating, average location rating, etc. in the data?
  * Only have availability, don't know if this is because people are there or it was taken off of market
