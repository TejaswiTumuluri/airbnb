* Based on our analysis of ratings we collected for over 600;000 properties listed on Airbnb worldwide, we find that nearly 95% of Airbnb properties boast an average user-generated rating of either 4.5 or 5 stars (the maximum); virtually none have less than a 3. 5 star rating. We contrast this with the ratings of approximately half a million hotels worldwide that we collected on TripAdvisor, where there is a much lower average rating of 3.8 stars, and more variance across reviews
* Ratings and reviews are central to platform : build trust, facilitate trade, determine how listings are ranked
* Trust can be challenging to build in marketplaces that are loosely regulated (like that in the sharing economy)
* Cross listed properties on TripAdvisor and Airbnb: 14% have 4.5 stars on Airbnb than on TripAdvisor
* Based on searches, Airbnb customers tend to be more price sensitive
* Reviews are critical to the individual success of the seller and Airbnb as a whole
* hosts take great lengths to avoiding negative reviews (like rejecting guests that are “unsuitable” or listing the location a second time on a new page)
