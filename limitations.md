## Limitations of the dataset
* Personal incentives for fraud (i.e. people having their friends "stay" without paying and leave a good review so 
that the host gets some sort of incentive).
* We can only see data regarding guests in the US. Guests may have reviews for listings outside the US, but we don't have that information.
